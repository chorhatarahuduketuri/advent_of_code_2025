# Advent of Code 2025

Let's see if I can even get to 12 this year....

Day 1: good grief that was a faff. never trust division. \
Day 2: spent a lot of time trying to solve star 1 before realising it was very simple, then the unused overcomplicated solution to star 1 turned out to be the already finished solution to star 2. \
Day 3: well that was absolutely no fun at all - it's some leetcode bullshit now. \
Day 4: easiest so far, I think partly due to the puzzle and partly due to my star 1 solution being useful for star 2. \
Day 5: well that was an interesting exercise in memory efficiency, and 'elegance' vs memory efficiency.
